==========BAG-OF-WORDS IMAGE CLASSIFICATION==========
To test and compare different parameter settings, you may call the file "frame.m" within MATLAB, and set it with a number of different parameters.
It will output the Average Precision per class as an array of the form:

av_mean =

    airplanes AP    cars AP    faces AP    motorbikes AP

and the Mean Average Precision over all classes in the form:

av_mean_p =

    MAP

==========PARAMETER SETTINGS==========
The different parameters may be set by calling "frame.m" as follows:

frame(histogram_sample_number, SVM_sample_number, test_number, cluster_size, SIFT_type, color_space, window_size, step_size)

Parameter               | Function
-----------------------------------------------
histogram_sample_number	| How many training samples from each class to use for creating feature histograms (int)
SVM_sample_number		| How many training samples from each class to use for training the SVM classifier (int)
test_number				| The number of images from each class the classifier should be tested on (int)
cluster_size			| The size of the clusters used in histogram creation (int)
SIFT_type				| The type of SIFT to be used in feature extraction from the list ['key', 'dense'] (string)
color_space				| The color space to be used in classification from the list ['gray', 'normalizedRGB', 'RGB', 'Opponent'] (string)
window_size				| The size(s) of the window used in dense sampling [only used if SIFT_type='dense'] (array)
step_size				| The step size between windows used in dense sampling [only used if SIFT_type='dense'] (int)

=========DEMO RUN==========
The default settings for the program can be run by issuing the following command in MATLAB:

frame(75, 75, 50, 400, 'dense', 'opponent', [4 8], 20)
